# WhatsAppReviews-SentimentAnalysis
A Deep Learning group (Zi Xu, Gavin, Wei Jun, and Yong De) assignment where we would need to scrape mobile application reviews from the Google Play Store, clean it, and create Recurrent Neural Network models that will generate an accurate sentiment score of a review.

We used the Google-Play-Scraper package to scrape mobile application reviews from the Google Play Store.

For the individual Recurrent Neural Network models, we each built a unique RNN model using the Keras library. Models that were built include: LSTM, SimpleRNN, GRU, and 1D CNN
